1. It is a Structural design pattern.
2. It use to reduce memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects.

Benefits of Flyweight Pattern:
--------------------------------
1. Memory Efficient: Instead of creating multiple instances of the same object (like the character 'A'), we reuse them, saving memory.
2. Better Performance: Reduces the number of objects being created.
3. Decouples Shared State from Specific State: The shared state is stored in the flyweight objects, while the varying states are kept outside in the context.


When to Use Flyweight:
--------------------------
1. When your application creates a large number of similar objects.
2. When you need to reduce memory consumption in systems with a large amount of data sharing.
